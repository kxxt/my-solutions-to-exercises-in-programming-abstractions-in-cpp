# My Solutions to Exercises in *Programming Abstractions in C++*

This repo contains my solutions to exercises in book *Programming Abstractions in C++*

Some solutions may contain mistake or errors since I didn't fully tested them.

Some projects are generated using a template [empty-project](./empty-project), which is a template project provided by Stanford CS106B/X courses.

Many of the solutions are done in a quick and dirty way (that is, usually very few comments in code.) because I am in a rush.
